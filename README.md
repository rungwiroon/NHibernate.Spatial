## NHibernate.Spatial

This is a fork of the final commit to NHibernate.Spatial at [Nhibernate Contrib][NHContrib] site made in december 2011. 
The code has been updated to compile with the latest NTS, GeoAPI and NHibernate binaries.

## Nuget Packages

The packages listed below are compatible with NHibernate 4.0.4 GA.

[Nhibernate.Spatial for Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NHibernate.Spatial.MsSql/)

[Nhibernate.Spatial for MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NHibernate.Spatial.MySQL/)
 
[Nhibernate.Spatial for PostGis](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NHibernate.Spatial.PostGis/)

## Getting Started
For configuring your application, please refer to [Configuration and Mapping](http://nhibernate.info/doc/spatial/configuration-and-mapping.html) on the NHForge Wiki. 
Furthermore you can read about [sample usage](http://nhibernate.info/doc/spatial/sample-usage.html). For an updated in-depth look at NHibernate.Spatial, you can 
read [this excellent blog post](http://build-failed.blogspot.no/2012/02/nhibernate-spatial-part-1.html) written by Pedro Sousa.

For general NHibernate help, the NHibernate community website - <http://nhibernate.info/> - has a range of resources to help you get started with basic NHibernate,
including [wikis][NHWiki], [blogs][NHWiki] and [reference documentation][NH]. 

## Discussion Forum
Discussion is made through the [NHibernate.Spatial Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nhibernate-spatial). Feel free to join in with suggestions or thoughts!

## Request for Contributors 
All contributors are welcome. We need help improving the current dialects, getting tests to pass, identifying and fixing bugs, and keeping the project going.
